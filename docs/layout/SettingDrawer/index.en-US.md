## SettingDrawer

Similar to [SettingDrawer](https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/blob/v1/packages/layout/src/components/SettingDrawer/index.tsx) of [Ant Design Pro](https://pro.ant.design/), but can place it anywhere, such as global header.

### Import

```jsx | pure
import {SettingDrawer} from '@yookue/ant-buddy-pro';
```

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SettingDrawer} from '@yookue/ant-buddy-pro';

export default () => {
    return (
        <SettingDrawer hideHintAlert hideCopyButton/>
    );
}
```

### Properties

See [SettingDrawer](https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/blob/v1/packages/layout/src/components/SettingDrawer/index.tsx)
